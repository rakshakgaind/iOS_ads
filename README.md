featuring refined ad formats and streamlined APIs for access to mobile ad
networks and advertising solutions. The SDK enables mobile app developers to
maximize their monetization in native mobile apps.

# Examples

Each iOS example app includes a Podfile and a Podfile.lock. The Podfile.lock
tracks the version of each Pod specified in the Podfile that was used to build
the release of the iOS example apps.

1. Run `pod install` in the same directory as the Podfile.
1. [Optional] Run `pod update` to get the latest version of the SDK.
1. Open the .xcworkspace file with Xcode and run the app.

See the [CocoaPods Guides](https://guides.cocoapods.org/)
for more information on installing and updating pods.
